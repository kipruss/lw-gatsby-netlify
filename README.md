## Gatsby's default starter

This project created using the [Gatsby Default Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

0. **Start with Netlify.**

    First of all, you can deploy this project to the Netlify (or Vercel) and in the same time clone it to your own github. See the links below.

1.  **Install the dependencies.**

    After cloning the code you need to install the dependencies

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```

1.  **Set environment variables.**

    Rename the `dotenv` file to the `.env.development` and/or `.env.development`. And fill your Contentful Access tokens

    ```shell
    GATSBY_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
    GATSBY_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
